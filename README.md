# Statistics and Probability for Machine Learning

## Implementing Statistics and Probability to the data for Machine Learning

### Purpose:
This repository demonstrates how to apply Descriptive Statistics and Probability Distributions to the model before selecting ML algorithms. The projects also include visual graphs to make it easier to understand the data and its patterns. 

### List of Projects:
 - Project 1: {Descriptive_stats_student_score}
 - Project 2: {Probability_distributions_baku_house}

### Brief explanation
 - Project 1:
     - Part 1:
       - Calculating mean, mode and median of each subject.
       - Calculating the standart deviation and variance.
       - Visualizing average score frequencies with Emprical Rule Ranges.
     - Part 2:
       - Calculating the first, median and third quartile of each subject.
       - Finding the Z-scores.
     - Part 3:
       - Calculating the skewness of each subject.
       - Interpretation.
       - Calculating the kurtosis.

 - Project 2:
   - Data preprocessing and label encoding
   - Calculating the probabilities of **category, title_deed, repair, room_number, region, area** variables.
   - Implementing Bernoulli Distribution to **category, title_deed and repair** variables.
   - Implementing Categorical Distribution to **room_number, region** variables.
   - Implementing Gaussian Distribution to **area** variable.
   - Calculating the skewness and kurtosis of **area** variable and Interpretation
